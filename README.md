While building this project I learned to:

- Used MySQL2 package to connect to my MySQL database to perform queries  
- Implemented the console.table package to print MySQL row to the console
- Use simple query to manage an employee's role, department, and update employee or add new employee. 
- Used Node.js module as well as inquirer, express package to have fast web framework that has routing and middleware functionality.
